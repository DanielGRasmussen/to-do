# Overview

This is a simple terminal based to-do list with cloud storage. You run it and select what you would like to do (view list, add item to list, or remove item from list.)

I made this to learn more about cloud storage and figure out how to use it.

# Cloud Database

I used Firebase. It basically tries to be a list/array with the keys but isnt.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code on Windows 10 with Python and firebase_admin.

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* [Firebase/Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)
* [Firebase/Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup)

# Future Work

* Fully delete from database (currently sets to None to avoid errors)
* Make it notify client of changes.
